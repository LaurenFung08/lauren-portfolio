        <p class = top-p> Hi! My name is Lauren and I am a third year Mechanical Enginnering student at the University of Waterloo. With my love of STEM 
            and my curiosity for innovation, I have developed a passion for applying engineering principles to real-life challenges. 
            I excel in hands-on, dynamic environments where problem-solving, creativity, and technical expertise come together
            to drive meaningful solutions.
        </p>

        <img id = headshot src = "./home/headshot.jpg" width = 350/>

        <p> With experience in CAD software (SolidWorks, AutoCAD, Revit MEP), programming (C++, HTML, CSS), and prototyping techniques such 
            as 3D printing and machining, I enjoy bringing designs from concept to reality. My background includes MEP engineering, 
            building science initaitives and various mechanical projects, where I developed problem-solving and collaboration skills in team-driven environments.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am eager to continue learning and applying my skills to projects that push the boundaries of technology and sustainabilty. 
            Whether it be designing mechanical systems, optimizing building performance, or contributing to energy efficient solutions, 
            my goal is to create impactful and progressive engineering advancements.
        </p>

                <p>
                    Through my projects, I have had the opportunity to explore my creativity while applying the skills I've gained from both 
                    academic and professional avenues. Hands-on projects such as designing a toy crossbow and building a dog feeder have been some 
                    of the most rewarding aspects of my studies thus far. These venutres have given me a sense of satisfaction and pride in 
                    knowing I was able to create something that works and serves a meaningful purpose.
