                    Through my projects, I have had the opportunity to explore my creativity while applying the skills I've gained from both 
                    school and work. Hands-on projects such as designing a toy crossbow and building a dog feeder have been some 
                    of the most rewarding aspects of being in this field. These venutres have given me a sense of satisfaction and pride in knowing I was able to create something that works and serves a meaningful purpose.
