        <h1 class = project-title > Solidworks Design </h1>

        <p>
            I have developed strong proficiency in SolidWorks through a range of creative and mechanically detailed design 
            projects. Drawing inspiration from the Star Wars universe, I created 3D models of a lightsaber, TIE fighter, 
            and Jango Fett helmet keychain, each showcasing precision modeling and attention to detail. I also designed a 
            functional butterfly knife, where I applied advanced mating techniques to simulate realistic motion and mechanical 
            constraints. These projects highlight both my technical skill in CAD and my passion for bringing imaginative 
            concepts to life through engineering design.

                In terms of software design, we programmed the robot using C++ on the EV3 platsome with a combination of 
                sensir data and grid logic to manage tile placemetn. One of the trickiest parts was accounting for mechanical
                inaccuracies; small errors in movement or sensor readings tended to accumulate over time and throw off the whole 
                mosaic. To address this, I developed an inaccuracy counter that actively tracked deviation in position and tile 
                placement, which alled the robot to make micro-adjustments mid-run, providing a sense of self-correction without 
                the hassle of re-calibration. This feature significantly improved long-run accuracy and made the robot much more 
                reliable.

                The trigger mechanism is modeled after a crossbow, designed to securely hold and release the projectile 
                with minimal force. Initially prototyped from aluminum, the final version was constructed from wood for 
                increased performance and decreased mass. A guiding ramp was added to ensure a smooth and accurate launch.
