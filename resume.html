        <p>
            I've worked in a mix of technical and hands-on roles where I gained experience in building science, 
            energy efficiency, and working with people. From conducting energy assessments to improve home efficiency 
            for low-income communities, to supporting building operations like HVAC, plumbing, and electrical systems, 
            I've built a solid foundation in the building science field. However, I'm excited to expand my experience 
            in different industries to figure out which one I want to pursue post-undergrad. I've also spent time 
            coaching kids, working in fast food, and helping out at a law office, which has taught me how to adapt, 
            communicate effectively, and stay organized in diverse environments.
