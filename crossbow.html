        <h1 class = project-title > Toy Crossbow Project </h1>

        <p>
            This project was the first real project that I tackled from start to finish, and one of my most 
            memorable at that. Our prompt was to simple: to make a toy for children; the rest was up to
            our imagination. This was a big and quite open-ended task for a bunch of first-year engineering 
            students with no concrete prior experience; it was all new to us, from the ideation and 
            conceptulization, to sourcing materials, CAD, and prototyping, to finally manufacturing and writing 
            our final report. All in all, it was a rewarding and valuable experience as the first of many projects
            to come.

            Our toy was called the Sticky Bow: a crossbow-style toy with a motorized recall mechanism that allowed 
            users to reel back projectiles after firing. The bullet was designed with a sticky front face that can 
            attach to objects, allowing users to pull them back with the recall function. Inspired by Nerf guns, 
            sticky hands, and crossbows, we combined the best features of each product to create a fun and innovative
            new toy!

                The toy was built out of a PVC pipe as the main body, 3D printed parts to fit the recall mechanism, and 
                wood for the trigger mechanism. The recall mechanism was a motorized system consisting of a custom 3D-printed
                reel, a manual clutch with friction plates and springs, and a housed motor inside of the PVC pipe. Once the
                projectile sticks to an object, pushing the recall button activates the motor, reeling both the bullet and 
                attached object to the user.

                The trigger mechanism is modeled after a crossbow, designed to securely hold and release the projectile 
                with minimal force. Initially prototyped from aluminum, the final version was constructed from wood for 
                increased performance and decreased mass. A guiding ramp was added to ensure a smooth and accurate launch.
